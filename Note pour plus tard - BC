- What's the difference between web3.eth.coinbase and web3.eth.accounts[0]?
    web3.eth.accounts[0] = first address created on Eth node
    web3.eth.coinbase = account in which your mining 
    -> when juste 1 accounts this is the same 
    more on that : https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3081/what-is-coinbase?rq=1
- String[i], i is a uint256  

-use console to debug much easier to see inside 


Brownie console utile commande:
    exemple : voting = accounts[0].deploy(SimpleVoting,[b'Djokovic',b'Nadal'])
    -> to get the contract
    dir(voting) -> To get all attribute and methode availble from the contract
